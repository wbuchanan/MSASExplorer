__Why did the size of the points change?__
When you selected the "Size Points Based on # of Students" option, it told the 
underlying program to make the width of each dot proportional to the total 
number of students used to calculate each of the the component scores on the 
graph.  

__Why is this useful/helpful?__
Different sized schools have distinct strengths.  Although very small schools 
may not have the same capacity to offer a wide variety of courses to their 
students, they offer a unique opportunity for educators to get to know their 
students in a way that would not exist in a school two or three times the size.  
It also provides another point of comparison that you can use to develop a deeper 
understanding of the data.
