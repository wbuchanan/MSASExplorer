__What is the trend line?__
The trend line that you selected is a useful and concise way to summarize the 
strength of a relationship between two variables.  For example, if you leave the 
trend line on and look at Math Proficiency Points and RLA Proficiency Points, 
you'll see that the line goes up.  This shows that as the school performed
better in math, it also performed better in Reading/Language Arts.  

__What's the area around the line mean?__
The area around the line is called the "standard error."  If you remember watching 
the news during election time, there are always polls showing that some percentage 
of Americans think this or that.  Usually, there's a standard error somewhere on 
the screen.  It probably looks something like "Â± 5%" which is another way of saying 
that the results are accurate within a _margin of error_.  The standard error is 
a way of showing how accurate the result of the trend line is.
